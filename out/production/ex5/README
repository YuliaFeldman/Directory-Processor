===== FILES =====
=================

-sorting package: This package is responsible for sorting files according to a given order.
-filtering package: This package is responsible for filtering files according to a given filter.
-filesprocessing package: This package is responsible for reading user's input, converting it to
commends and processing them.
-README:   This file.

===== DESIGN ====
=================

We decided to split our program into three packages; each package is responsible for a different part of the
exercise. The fileprocessing package is the main package: it contains classes which are responsible for
 receiving inputs from user and translating it into Cmd object. Then, it processes (by using the sorting and
 filtering packages) the command and prints the proper output. The other two packages are responsible for
 sorting and filtering the files in the source directory. The filtering package is designed by using an
 abstract class, FilterManager, and all the other filters inherit from it. In addition, we used factory
 design pattern to create Sorter and Filter objects.

=============================================
== Description of the exceptions hierarchy ==
=============================================

The parent Exceptions class is DirectoryProcessorEx, which inherits java's Exception class.
ReaderManagerException and FiltersManagerException inherit from  DirectoryProcessorEx.
ReaderSortEx inherits from ReaderManagerException.
We chose this design because we think in this way we can handle each warning and error in the most
suitable place for it. This makes our code more readable and easy to understand.

=====================================
== How we sorted the matched files ==
=====================================

Our program contains SorterManager class, which is responsible for creating a linked list with the sorted
files. Each of the sorting classes (abs, type and size) implemented the Comperator Java class.
All of these classes implemented the compare method differently, according to the order each class
represents. We chose to use the Linked List data structure so that we could keep the order of the sorted
files.
